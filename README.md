Parkour Vision - The Parkour Training Spots App
===============================================

An open-source free iOS app for mapping training spot photos near you and adding photos of new locations to the global Parkour Training Spots group on Flickr

---

Caveat
======
We're new to Github and opensource. Seeking developers who are interested and available to not only contribute new features but also improve code that's already there, and help build a fun community around this app. 

How it works
============

Currently the app is just an extension of the [Training Spots Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/parkourspots/) using the Flickr API and Google Maps. 

Photos in the group are required to have geodata associated with them (through Flickr tagging or GPS data) and are focused on any location that parkour practitioners would find interesting.

How to build
============

The project should compile in Xcode 4 and above once cloned to your machine. To test it well you'll need to run it on an iOS device and be added to the provisioning profile for development. Tyson can do this for you: tyson@parkourvisions.org


How to contribute
=================

[Fork it](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/), play with it, submit it :)
