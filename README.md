Parkour Vision - The Parkour Training Spots App
===============================================

An open-source free iOS app for mapping photos and adding new locations to the global Parkour Training Spots group on Flickr

---

How it works
===

Currently the app is just an extension of the [Training Spots Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/parkourspots/) using the Flickr API and Google Maps. 

Photos in the group are required to have geodata associated with them (through Flickr tagging or GPS data) and are focused on any location that parkour practitioners would find interesting.
